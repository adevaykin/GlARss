Face tracking application based on the Google Services face detection API. Made on hackathon, meant to be used on the hackathon.
Detects faces of registered users, translates speech to text and shows this information near the users face in realtime.
A lot of code is a copy-paste from tutorials and official documentation.
Have fun.
