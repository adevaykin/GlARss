Face tracking application based on the Google Services face detection API. Made during a hackathon, meant to be demonstrated on the hackathon.
Detects faces of registered users, translates speech to text and shows this information near the users face in realtime.
A lot of code is a copy-paste from tutorials and official documentation.
Have fun.
